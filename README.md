- 👋 Hi, I’m Gonzalo Romero and im 27 yo. I have been studying different branches of programming for several years now, being my first foray into this world at the age of 15, when I programmed a "mod" for a computer game called S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
Since then, my passion and motivation grew when I saw the infinite possibilities that programming offers us.
- 👀 I’m interested in programing, new technologies, and maybe you think I'm crazy, but I'm passionate about working with databases SQL,for me working with databases is mantric. PGAdmin is my favorite tool. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Programation in Teclab, a private university in Argentina with official endorsement from the ministry of education. At this moment I am deepening my knowledge in Java and HTML, and acquiring new ones in Python, being my "native language" C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other programmers, developers and companies. There is no job that I say no to.
- 📫 How to reach me: gonzalohr.programacion@gmail.com or +5413513497110 (Only WhatsApp).
